# pfitmap-shiny

This Shiny application presents data about hierarchically organized protein
families.

Currently, major changes to accomodate a new format of the input database are
being performed. See [pfitmap-db](https://github.com/erikrikarddaniel/pfitmap-db)
for tools to go from a set of [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/) output files to a
database.
